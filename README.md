Our application is designed to enhance the dining experience at a sushi restaurant for both customers and staff. Customers can easily browse the menu, add items to their cart, and make payments directly through the app, including the option to tip their server. Additionally, the app supports dietary preferences and restrictions, allowing diners to filter the menu according to their needs. For the restaurant staff, the app offers a robust back-end system to update the menu and manage orders efficiently. It also offers all-you-can-eat, buffet, and pay-as-you-eat options to cater to diverse dining preferences. It includes a staff login page for efficient management and check-in/check-out functionality for seamless transitions. These tools are developed with the dual goal of simplifying the ordering process for guests while streamlining kitchen and service operations, providing an intuitive and user-friendly platform to support a busy sushi establishment.
